                                        Pie <br>
                                        * 3 pounds good cooking apples such as Granny Smith, Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Fuji, or Braeburn (about 6 to 8 apples, depending on the size of your apples) <br>
                                        * 1 tablespoon lemon juice or apple cider vinegar <br>
                                        * 1/2 cup to 2/3 cup sugar, depending on how sweet you like your pie <br>
                                        * 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour <br>
                                        * 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon <br> 
                                        * 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice <br>
                                        * 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg <br>
                                        * 1 tablespoon brandy, optional (if you have Calvados apple brandy, use it!) <br>
                                        * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract <br>
                                        * 1 double crust sour cream pie dough, OR all-butter crust, OR your favorite pie crust recipe <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Egg wash <br> 
                                        * 1 large egg yolk <br>
                                        * 1 tablespoon cream</li>
                                    <li class="fw-bold">DIRECTIONS</li>
                                    <li>
                                        - Peel, core, and slice the apples: Peel, core and slice or roughly chop the apples into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices or chunks. As you cut your apple slices, add them to a large bowl and toss them with the lemon juice or apple cider vinegar to help keep them from turning brown. <br>
                                        - Make the apple pie filling: Combine the sugar, flour and spices (allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon) in a bowl. Add the flour mixture to the apple slices and use your hands to distribute the flour through the apples so they are well coated. Sprinkle with brandy (if using) and vanilla extract and stir to coat all the apples. <br>
                                        - Preheat the oven to 375°F. Place one oven rack in the lowest position and put a large rimmed baking sheet on it to catch any drippings from the pie. Position a second rack the next rung up (still in the lower third of the oven). <br>
                                        - Roll out the dough and line the pie plate: Remove one disk of pie dough from the refrigerator. Let sit at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes. Place disk on a lightly floured, clean, flat surface. Using a rolling pin, roll out the pie dough to a 12-inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick. As you roll out the dough, check to make sure it isn't sticking. If and when it starts to stick, gently lift it up and sprinkle a little more flour on the table surface or on the pie dough to keep the dough from sticking. Gently place the rolled out dough onto a 9-inch pie plate. Press down to line the pie dish with the dough. <br>
                                        - Add the apple filling: Arrange the apple slices in the dough-lined pie plate. Mound the apples in the center. <br>
                                        - Roll out the top crust, place over apples, trim and crimp edges: Roll out the second disk of dough, again to 12-inches. Gently place the second round of pie dough over the apples. Trim excess dough with kitchen shears, leaving a 3/4 inch overhang from the edges of the pie pan. Fold the dough under itself so that the edge of the fold comes right to the edge of the pan. Press the top and bottom dough rounds together as you flute edges using thumb and forefinger or press with a fork. <br>
                                        - Brush with the egg wash and cut vents: Place egg yolk and cream in a small bowl and use a fork to stir until well combined. Use a pastry brush to brush the egg wash over the top and fluted edges of the pie. Use a sharp knife to cut slits in the top of the pie crust for steam vents. <br>
                                        - Bake: Place pie on oven rack centered over the baking sheet on the rack below it to catch any drippings. Bake the pie at 375°F until crust begins to lightly brown, about 20 minutes, then reduce heat to 350°F. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the juices are bubbling all over, an additional hour or up to another hour and a half, depending on the type of apples you are using. If you have an instant-read thermometer, it should read 200°F when inserted in the center of the pie. <br>
                                        - Cool: Transfer the apple pie to a rack to cool for at least 1 hour. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature. Great with a side of vanilla ice cream.

                                        * 1 cup natural unsweetened cocoa powder <br>

                                        * 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt <br>
                                        * 1 cup powdered sugar</li>

                                        - Beat together the cocoa powder, white sugar, and vegetable oil: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or beat by hand with a wooden spoon) beat together the cocoa powder, white sugar, and vegetable oil until it comes together into a shiny, gritty, black dough of sorts. <br>
                                        - Add the eggs, one at a time, and then the vanilla: Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing for 30 seconds each. Add the vanilla and beat in thoroughly. <br>
                                        - Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder if using. <br>
                                        - Beat the dry ingredients into the cocoa-oil mix: Mix into the chocolate mixture on low speed until just combined. Do not over-beat. <br>
                                        - Cover and chill: Cover the dough with plastic wrap and chill the dough for four hours or overnight. <br>
                                        - Preheat the oven and prepare the baking sheets:Preheat the oven to 350°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Place the powdered sugar in a wide bowl. <br>
                                        - Roll the cookies: Using a rounded teaspoon, scoop out clumps of the chilled dough and roll them into 1-inch (2.5 cm) sized balls using your hands. Do several at a time and drop them into the powdered sugar as you go. The dough will be quite sticky, so it's useful to roll the dough in batches.Roll the balls in the powdered sugar and place on the cookie sheets spaced a few inches apart. (You should be able to get 12 to 16 on each sheet). <br>
                                        - Bake: Bake at 350°F for 10 to 13 minutes. Allow to cool a minute or two on the sheets before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with any remaining batter.</li>

                                        * 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves <br>               
                                        * 1 can (15 oz) pumpkin (not pumpkin pie mix) <br>
                                        * 1 can (12 oz) evaporated milk <br>

                                        Sweetened Whipped Cream <br>
                                        * 3/4 cup whipping cream <br>
                                        * 2 tablespoons sugar</li>

                                    <li>
                                        * 1Heat oven to 425°F. In medium bowl, mix flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the oil with fork until all flour is moistened. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all water is absorbed. Shape pastry into a ball. Press in bottom and up side of 9-inch glass pie plate. <br>
                                        * In large bowl, beat eggs slightly with wire whisk or hand beater. Beat in 1/2 cup sugar, the cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon salt, ginger, cloves, pumpkin and milk. <br>
                                        * To prevent spilling, place pastry-lined pie plate on oven rack before adding filling. Carefully pour pumpkin filling into pie plate. Bake 15 minutes. <br>                    
                                        * Reduce oven temperature to 350°F. Bake about 45 minutes longer or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Place pie on cooling rack. Cool completely, about 2 hours. <br>
                                        * In chilled medium bowl, beat whipping cream and 2 tablespoons sugar with electric mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form. Serve pie with whipped cream. Store in refrigerator.</li>

                                        * 2 1/2 cups (350g) all-purpose four <br>                   
                                        * 2 to 4 tablespoons nonfat milk powder (see Recipe Note) <br>
                                        * 1 teaspoon salt <br>  
                                        * 1 teaspoon baking soda <br>       
                                        * 3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar <br> 
                                        * 3/4 cup (161g) dark brown sugar <br>          
                                        * 1 cup (8 ounces) unsalted butter, very soft <br>
                                        * 2 large eggs <br>             
                                        * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract <br>                        
                                        * 12 ounce bag (about 2 cups) semisweet chocolate chips 
                                    </li>
                                    <li class="fw-bold">DIRECTIONS</li>

                                        - Mix the dry ingredients: In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, milk powder, salt, and baking soda and whisk to mix. Set aside. <br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                        - Beat the sugars and the butter: With an electric mixer or in a stand mixer with a beater attachment, beat together the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and softened butter on medium speed until combined, 30 to 60 seconds. Pick out any large pebbles of hard brown sugar that you see. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters. <br>
                                        - Mix in the eggs and vanilla: Add the two eggs and vanilla to the butter-sugar mixture and beat at medium speed until no clumps or streaks remain, 10 to 20 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters. <br>
                                        - Mix in the flour mixture: Add the flour mixture all at once. Beat on low speed just until no more dry streaks of flour are visible, 20 to 40 seconds. You may still see some flecks of milk powder -- this is fine. <br>
                                        - Mix in the chocolate chips: Add all of the chocolate chips and beat on low speed for just a few seconds until the chips are evenly incorporated. <br>                                                             
                                        - Chill the dough: Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beater. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to three days. (Or freeze in individual scoops for up to 3 months.) <br>                                                                                                                                                                              
                                        - Heat the oven to 375F: Place a rack in the middle of the oven. Line two baking sheet with silicon baking mats or parchment. I usually bake my cookies one sheet at a time to help them bake evenly. If you prefer, or are crunched for time, bake two sheets at a time with one sheet in the upper third of the oven and the other in the lower third of the oven. <br>
                                        - Scoop the dough: <br>                                                                                                                                                 
                                        - Use a medium cookie scoop (or a well-mounded tablespoon measure) to scoop the dough out onto one of the baking sheet. Space the cookies about 2 inches apart. <br>                                                                            
                                        - Bake the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes: While the first batch bakes, scoop the cookies for the next batch. The cookies are done when they look slightly puffed in the middle and are starting to turn toasty at the edges. <br>
                                        - Cool the cookies: Cool the cookies on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes, or until the puffed middles collapse and the cookies have firmed a little. Transfer the cookies to a wire cooling rack to cool completely. <br>
